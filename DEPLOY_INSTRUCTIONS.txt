🚀 QUICK DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR GITHUB PAGES
==========================================

STEP 1: Install gh-pages package
---------------------------------
Open terminal in the client folder and run:
  cd client
  npm install --save-dev gh-pages

STEP 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages
-------------------------------
Run this command:
  npm run deploy

This will:
  ✅ Build your React app
  ✅ Create a 'gh-pages' branch
  ✅ Deploy the build folder to GitHub Pages

STEP 3: Configure GitHub Pages Settings
----------------------------------------
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/arnavmarkali7-star/EduMart
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select:
   - Branch: gh-pages
   - Folder: / (root)
5. Click "Save"

STEP 4: Wait for Deployment
----------------------------
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to deploy
- Your site will be available at: https://arnavmarkali7-star.github.io/EduMart/

STEP 5: Update Your Deployment (When You Make Changes)
-------------------------------------------------------
Every time you make changes to your app, run:
  cd client
  npm run deploy

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

1. Backend API: GitHub Pages only hosts static files. Your backend won't work on GitHub Pages.
   You need to deploy your backend separately to:
   - Heroku
   - Railway
   - Render
   - Vercel
   - DigitalOcean
   - AWS

2. Routing: The app now uses HashRouter which adds '#' to URLs.
   Example: https://arnavmarkali7-star.github.io/EduMart/#/products
   This is required for GitHub Pages to work correctly.

3. API URLs: Update your API calls to point to your production backend URL.
   Create a .env.production file in client/ with:
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Issue: Blank page
Solution: 
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Clear browser cache
  - Make sure build was successful

Issue: 404 Error on refresh
Solution: 
  - Already fixed with HashRouter
  - Make sure you're using the deployed version

Issue: API calls not working
Solution: 
  - Deploy backend to cloud service
  - Update API URLs in your code
  - Update CORS settings in backend
